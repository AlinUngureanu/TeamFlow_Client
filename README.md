# TeamFlow_Client

The desktop client provides managers with an interface for quick and organized access to team and departmental structure. The application allows detailed viewing of all employees and managers, grouped by department, providing a clear view of the internal organization.

In addition to displaying information, the desktop client includes email functionality, allowing managers to select employees and send them messages directly from the application. This facilitates internal communication, eliminating the need to use external applications for correspondence.
